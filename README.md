# Smart-Portable-Charger 
Charged through Solar Panels, Measuring Battery Level, Displaying data on the Web and App

This was a class project I completed while studying for a year at the Technological University of the Shannon in Athlone, Ireland. 
The project requirements allowed us to choose:
 - A controller of our choice (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, ESP32, Jetson Nano, STM32...)
 - Sensors (passive/active, analog/digital, modules, I2C/SPI, serial/one-wire...)
 - A method to send data to a dashboard (e.g., Processing, HTML/CSS/PHP/JS, website, local server, cloud-based system, LAMP/FLASK, MQTT...)
 - Connectivity options (such as infrared, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa...)

Our team decided to create a Smart Portable Charger because we wanted to develop something practical that we could use later on. The charger could power itself using energy from solar panels and send the collected data to a website and a mobile app that we also developed.
